**“Thanks Meta”**

This is a short post but as I don’t post much aside from code online, but I just wanted to say, “Thanks Meta”.


For a research project, I was just about to finetune llama2 on python code and literally today Meta drops Code Llama. I realize that the model isn’t <i>just</i> for me but epic! Now we can just finetune code llama for codex related tasks (if that’s even necessary, evaluation of the model on my end still needs to be done).
