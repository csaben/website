In this post, I'm going to read through a [`first pass`](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)
of the aforementioned paper. This is in an effort to get as many [`hours`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0) in as possible prior to diving into my independent summer research. 

DRAFT:
* go through each major header, summarize key things that are worth mentioning, link any studies if it adds value
<!-- insert image of functional vs anatomical maps (how? lol)-->
Recency: Published 2013

Sub headers
* Abstract
* what do functional and anatomical maps reveal?
* parallel and antagonistic pathways complicate circuits
* Neuromodulation reconfigures circuit properties
* Neuronal dynamics shape the activity of circuits
* Vertebrate retina also has complex circuit properties
* Circuits interact to generate behavior
* How can we ‘solve’ the brain?
    is this identifiable now (a decade later)?
	" 
	Big science works best
	when the goals of a project are well-defined and when the out-
	comes can be easily recognized. Both were true about the human
	genome project, but neither is true, yet, about large-scale attempts
	to understand the brain.

Summary of what complicates understanding neuron information flow and circuit-level dynamics:
* synaptic plasticity can occur on rapid timescales to strengthen and weaken synapses based on use, adding complexity to circuit-level dynamics
