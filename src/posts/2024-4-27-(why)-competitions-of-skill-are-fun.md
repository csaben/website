In life, there are many opportunities vying for your attention at any given time. Of them, you usually will choose a subset of short term, long term, and maybe life goals (I'm being a bit reductive, but this is the thrust of it). The long term goals you may set for yourself are actionable but not guaranteed to be a "win"  if/when you do achieve them.

That is why local contests of skill are so elegant. Defining a clear set of rules and an objective just feels so nice. 

Being able to simply give something your all in a relatively short time scale (hackathons, sports, etc.) allows, in spite of all the complexity of life, a modicum of what it feels like to indisputably *just fricking win.* 

Even if you don't win, just having the opportunity to give everything you currently have and evaluate your ability is epic.
